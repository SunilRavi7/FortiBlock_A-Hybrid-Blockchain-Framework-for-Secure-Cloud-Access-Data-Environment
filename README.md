## üîç Project Overview
FortiBlock is a blockchain-powered security framework designed to provide two-way data protection and secure access control for cloud environments. Traditional centralized cloud access control systems are prone to single points of failure, insider threats, and lack of transparency, making them vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized modifications.

Our project addresses these challenges by integrating blockchain technology, cryptographic security, and scalable cloud infrastructure to enhance data protection and implement decentralized access management.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Decentralized Access Control**: Tamper-proof blockchain storage of access rights with blockchain account addresses serving as user identities
- **Hybrid Blockchain Architecture**: Combines public blockchain transparency with private blockchain confidentiality
- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES encryption for data security before cloud storage
- **Secure Authentication**: SHA-256 hashing for user credential protection
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Automated permission grants, revocations, and monitoring through smart contracts
- **Immutable Access Logs**: Blockchain-based storage of metadata, transaction logs, and access records
- **Direct & Indirect Sharing**: Support for various data sharing models with security controls
- **Access Revocation**: Real-time revocation of permissions with cascade effect

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
FortiBlock employs a unique hybrid blockchain architecture with the following workflow:

![Architecture Flow](https://place-for-your-architecture-image.png)

1. **Data Owner Upload**: Resources are uploaded to cloud storage
2. **Cloud Verification**: Validation of uploaded data
3. **Permission Publishing**: Access permissions and authorizations recorded on blockchain
4. **User Resource Requests**: Data users request access to resources
5. **Request Validation**: Verification of user requests
6. **Permission Querying**: Blockchain verification of permissions
7. **Access Response**: Blockchain confirms or denies access
8. **Resource Delivery**: Providing access to authorized users
9. **Access Logging**: Recording all access activities on blockchain

## üîê Security Mechanisms

### AES Encryption Process
FortiBlock implements AES encryption with the following process:
1. Key Generation (128, 192, or 256 bits)
2. File division into fixed-size blocks
3. Application of substitution-permutation network:
   - SubBytes (S-Box substitution)
   - ShiftRows (cyclic shifting)
   - MixColumns (mathematical transformation)
   - AddRoundKey (XOR with round key)
4. Multiple round iterations based on key size
5. Final ciphertext generation
6. Secure encrypted file storage

### SHA-256/512 for Credential Protection
1. User registration with secure password hashing
2. Smart contract storage of irreversible credential hashes
3. Secure authentication through hash comparison
4. Immutable access attempt logging
