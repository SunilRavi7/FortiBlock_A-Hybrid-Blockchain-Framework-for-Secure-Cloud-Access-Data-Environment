## 📘 Description

FortiBlock is a blockchain-powered framework for secure access control in cloud systems. By integrating hybrid blockchain (public + private), AES encryption, and smart contracts, FortiBlock ensures two-way data protection, real-time access logging, and secure permission handling — all without relying on centralized trust.

Built using **Ethereum**, **Django**, **Node.js**, **Solidity**, and **AES**, the framework is efficient, scalable, and ideal for secure file sharing in modern cloud environments.
